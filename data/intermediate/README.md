# Intermediate

Generated by processing raw data, and subsequently used in other analyses.

All your files should be stored in one or more sub-directories within the `/data/intermediate`
directory, not directly in `/data/intermediate`. If you add directories, make sure that you update the `data_sources.csv` table found under `/data`. If this project does not contain intermediate data,
you can simply ignore this directory and store all your data in `/data/raw`.
