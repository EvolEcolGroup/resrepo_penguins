# Raw Data

A place to store 'baseline' project data. If you process these raw data to generate intermediate data that will be used in later analysis, store them in `/data/intermediate`

Examples of raw data: Fastq files of DNA/RNA-seq; Observational data; GPS data of moving birds...

All your files should be stored in one or more sub-directories within the `/data/raw`
directory, not directly in `/data/raw`. There is a `default` directory for you to use,
or you can remove it and replace it with other directories; make sure that you update the `data_sources.csv` table found under `/data`.
